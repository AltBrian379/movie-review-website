        <h3>Would You Watch It Again?</h3>
        <p>Welcome to the only movie review website where we ask <strong>Would You Watch It Again</strong>?</p>
        <p>We believe that the mainstream form of movie reviews don't capture what movie-goers want to know about a film! Instead, we determine a movie's quality on the grounds of a simple question.</p>
        <p>Some movies make you feel like <strong>Once is Enough</strong>, some you'll only watch <strong>If Its The Only Thing On</strong>, while with others you'll be wanting to say "<strong>I Want My Money Back</strong>". </p>
        <p>However, when a movie makes you think, "<strong>I Would Watch It Again</strong>", you know you got a good one on your hands. if it makes you want to watch it <strong>Religiously</strong>, you know you got something special</p>
